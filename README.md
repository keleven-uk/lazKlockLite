# lazKlockLite

A light version of Klock, only contains a LED klock.

But, also contains a countdown to a given event i.e. retirement.
The events are held in a text file, events.txt.
The entry should be in the form event, date, time.
If no date and time are given the event test is just displayed.

Also, contains the code to simulate the pressing of F15 - to keep monitors awake.
